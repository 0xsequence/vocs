**Privy is a simple toolkit for progressive authentication in web3.**

Privy allows you to meet your users where they are. What does that mean?

- **Onboard users across traditional and web3 authentication methods.** Users can sign in to your app with a crypto wallet, an email address, their phone number, or even a social profile (e.g., Twitter or Discord). Users don‚Äôt need to have a wallet to explore your product.
- **Enable progressive onboarding to boost user conversion.** Require a wallet from your user only once it‚Äôs needed. With fine-grained control over when to trigger authentication flows and wallet connections, you can improve conversion and craft better UX.
- **All auth methods create a common user object for your app.** A user is a user, regardless of whether they‚Äôve connected with a wallet, email or Discord account. No endless branching in your code logic to support more users. Allow users to link as many identifiers as they‚Äôd like to one underlying account.

For users who don‚Äôt have a self-custodial wallet, Privy will guide them through setting one up and connecting it to your app. Our simple library works for **all users and all devices** ‚Äì regardless of their authentication method, whether or not they have connected a wallet, or whether they‚Äôre on desktop or mobile.
