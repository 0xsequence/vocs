# Quickstart

The Privy React Auth SDK allows you to authenticate your users with Privy in your React app.

With just ten minutes of setup, you get:

- immediate support for email, SMS, wallet, and social (Google, Twitter, Discord, etc.) logins
- progressive authentication flows that reduce friction during onboarding
- out-of-the-box UIs, styled with your brand, that guide your users and keep them informed
- identity management across your user base
- and so much more!

:::details[Want to try Privy? Request access today!]
Request access to Privy using [this form](). We'll get back to you as soon as we can!

Until then, you can try out Privy using our test App ID: `clpispdty00ycl80fpueukbhl`.

The test App ID can only be used from the domain `http://localhost:3000`; **do not use it in production**. It is subject to heavy rate limiting, origin restriction, and regular data deletions. This ID is only intended to help you get a feel for Privy ahead of officially setting up a developer account!

## Steps

::::steps
### Installation

Install the [Privy React Auth SDK]() using `npm`:

```bash [Terminal]
npm install @privy-io/react-auth
```

### Get your API keys

To use Privy, the first step is to retrieve your Privy app ID from the developer console at [console.privy.io](). If this is your first time using Privy, please [reach out]() so we can set you up with a Privy account and app ID.

### Setting up your app

Once you have your app ID, **in your React project, wrap your components with a [`PrivyProvider`]()**. The `PrivyProvider` should wrap any component that will use the Privy SDK.

:::tip
If you're starting from scratch, we recommend using one of our templates to integrate Privy:

- a NextJS project ([GitHub](), [CodeSandbox]())
- a Create React App project ([GitHub](), [CodeSandbox]())
:::

For example, in a NextJS or Create React App project, you may wrap your components like so:

:::code-group

```tsx [Next.js (_app.tsx)]
import type {AppProps} from 'next/app';
import Head from 'next/head';
import {PrivyProvider} from '@privy-io/react-auth'; // [!code focus]

// This method will be passed to the PrivyProvider as a callback
// that runs after successful login.
const handleLogin = (user) => {
  console.log(`User ${user.id} logged in!`)
}

function MyApp({Component, pageProps}: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        {/* Edit your HTML header */}
      </Head>
      <PrivyProvider // [!code focus]
        appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID} // [!code focus]
        onSuccess={handleLogin} // [!code focus]
        config={{ // [!code focus]
          loginMethods: ['email', 'wallet'], // [!code focus]
          appearance: { // [!code focus]
            theme: 'light', // [!code focus]
            accentColor: '#676FFF', // [!code focus]
            logo: 'https://your-logo-url', // [!code focus]
          }, // [!code focus]
        }} // [!code focus]
      > // [!code focus]
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </PrivyProvider> // [!code focus]
    </>
  );
}
```

```tsx [Create React App (index.tsx)]
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import {PrivyProvider} from '@privy-io/react-auth'; // [!code focus]

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

// This method will be passed to the PrivyProvider as a callback
// that runs after successful login.
const handleLogin = (user) => {
  console.log(`User ${user.id} logged in!`)
}

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PrivyProvider // [!code focus]
      appId={process.env.REACT_APP_PRIVY_APP_ID} // [!code focus]
      onSuccess={handleLogin} // [!code focus]
      config={{ // [!code focus]
        loginMethods: ['email', 'wallet'], // [!code focus]
        appearance: { // [!code focus]
          theme: 'light', // [!code focus]
          accentColor: '#676FFF', // [!code focus]
          logo: 'https://your-logo-url', // [!code focus]
        }, // [!code focus]
      }} // [!code focus]
    > // [!code focus]
      <App />
    </PrivyProvider> // [!code focus]
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// See https://docs.privy.io/guide/troubleshooting/webpack for how to handle
// common build issues with web3 projects bootstrapped with Create React App
```

:::

The `PrivyProvider` takes the following properties:

- your `appId`
- an optional `onSuccess` callback which will execute once a user successfully logs in
- an optional `createPrivyWalletOnLogin` boolean to configure whether you'd like your users to create [embedded wallets]() when logging in
- an optional `config` property to customize your onboarding experience. Check out the links below for how to modify this object to configure:
    - [login methods, branding, and legal policies]()
    - [embedded wallet creation, recovery, and usage]()
    - [default and supported networks for wallets]()

### Just `usePrivy`! ðŸŽ‰

You can now use the Privy SDK throughout your app via the [`usePrivy` hook]()! Check out our [starter repo]() to see what a simple end-to-end integration looks like.

Read on to learn how you can use Privy to:

- log your users in
- prompt users to link additional accounts, as part of progressive onboarding
- interface with users' crypto wallets
- create Ethereum wallets embedded in your app
- and to do so much more!
