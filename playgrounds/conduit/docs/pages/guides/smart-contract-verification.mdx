# Smart Contract Verification

Conduit comes with a Blockscout instance, and you can verify against it with the url:

```txt 
https://explorer-[your_network_id].t.conduit.xyz/api\?
```

**Note:** See this [foundry issue](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5160#issuecomment-1631555377) for why you need to include `\?`

```bash 
forge verify-contract [address] [contract] --verifier=blockscout --verifier-url=https://explorer-[your_network_id].t.conduit.xyz/api\?
```
