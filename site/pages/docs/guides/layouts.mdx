# Layouts [Customizing the page layout in Vocs]

Vocs comes with two built-in layouts: the **default** docs layout, and a **minimal** layout.

You can specify which layout to use by setting the `layout` property in your frontmatter.

```mdx
---
layout: minimal
---

# A minimal page

This page uses a minimal layout.
```

:::info
An example of a `minimal` layout page can be found on the [Blog page](/blog).
:::

You can also control what elements are displayed on the page:

```mdx
---
sidebar: false
outline: false
logo: false
---

This is a page without a sidebar, outline, or logo.
```

```mdx
---
layout: minimal
logo: false
---

This is a minimal layout without the logo.
