# Layouts [Customizing the page layout in Vocs]

Vocs comes with three built-in layouts: `docs`, `landing`, and `minimal`.

You can specify which layout to use by setting the `layout` property in your frontmatter.

```md
---
layout: minimal // [!code focus]
---

# A minimal page

This page uses a minimal layout.
```

:::info
An example of a `minimal` layout page can be found on the [Blog page](/blog).

You can also control what elements are displayed on the page:

```md
---
showSidebar: false // [!code focus]
showOutline: false // [!code focus]
showLogo: false // [!code focus]
---

This is a page without a sidebar, outline, or logo.
```

```md
---
layout: minimal // [!code focus]
showLogo: false // [!code focus]
---

This is a minimal layout without the logo.
