# Code Snippets [Including code snippets in Markdown]

You can include code snippets in a Markdown file by making use of the `::snip` directive.

:::tip[Tip]
The `"::"` syntax refers to the [Directives Syntax Proposal](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/generic-directives-plugins-syntax/444).

::::steps

## Create the code snippet

First, we will create a snippet called `snippet.ts` that we will import into a Markdown file.

```ts [docs/snippets/snippet.ts]
import { writeFileSync } from "fs" 

writeFileSync("myfile.txt", "Hello world!")
```

## Import the snippet

Next, we will import the snippet into our Markdown file using the `::snip` directive.

```mdx [example.md]
### Usage

::snip{path="~/snippets/snippet.ts"}
```

:::info
The `"~"` in the path refers to the [root (`config.rootDir`) directory](/docs/structure#root-directory) of the project.
:::

## Output

The resulting output will look like this:

<div>
### Usage

```ts 
import { writeFileSync } from "fs" 

writeFileSync("myfile.txt", "Hello world!") // [!code focus]
```
</div>

## Bonus: Use code block features

We can include features like [line focus (`// [!code focus]`)](/docs/api/markdown#line-focus) in our code snippets.

```ts [docs/snippets/snippet.ts]
import { writeFileSync } from "fs" 

writeFileSync("myfile.txt", "Hello world!") !! [!code focus]
```

Which will result in the snippet being rendered like this:

```ts 
import { writeFileSync } from "fs" 

writeFileSync("myfile.txt", "Hello world!") // [!code focus]
```

## Bonus: Add a title

We can include a title for the code snippet by adding a title to the `::snip` directive.

```mdx [example.md]
### Usage

::snip[Example.ts]{path="~/snippets/snippet.ts"}
```

Which will result in the snippet being rendered like this:

```ts [Example.ts]
import { writeFileSync } from "fs" 

writeFileSync("myfile.txt", "Hello world!") // [!code focus]
```

## Bonus: Add Twoslash

We can include [Twoslash](/docs/guides/twoslash) for the code snippet by using the `::snip-twoslash` directive.

```mdx [example.md]
### Usage

::snip-twoslash[Example.ts]{path="~/snippets/snippet.ts"}
```

Which will result in the snippet being rendered like this:

```ts [Example.ts] twoslash
/// <reference types="node" />
// ---cut---
import { writeFileSync } from "fs" 

writeFileSync("myfile.txt", "Hello world!") // [!code focus]
```
